F dot val is the value produced by looking up this particular name inside the symbol table F dot symtab. What is the value of T to F? Whatever value produced by F is passed on to T. What is the value of T 2 star F? We take the value of T 2 dot val, we take the value of F dot val, and then we add up these two values and that is the value which is produced as the value of T 1.
