We will define testing strategies, so that we can maintain a control over the defects and
we can ensure a quality product from our approach. These are the different steps in the
preparation of a project plan. You need to identify the effort. You need to know how the
effort is being distributed, you need to commit resources for different steps and you need
to make explicit quality plans. Because quality will naturally have cost implications, you
will need to spend effort in identifying the defects, which might go from one step to
another through the various deliverables that the steps produce. So these are the different
project plan elements.
Once the project plan is in place we will use it for monitoring and control. The plan
defines the various activities we may represent it in different ways. There are Gantt chart,
Time bar chart or PERT by CPM type of activity networks which are used for
representing a plan. Essentially the plan shows the different activities. It shows expected
durations for different steps and what kinds of resources have been allocated to those
activities. In a network of activities like this, we can identify which is the critical path. If
we do not meet the schedule requirements for the critical path then the project may get
delayed. So we identify which are the critical activities and how to keep them under
control. So that they are carried out in the expected duration and in the expected cost. If it
is not done then there is going to be a significant impact on the overall project.
