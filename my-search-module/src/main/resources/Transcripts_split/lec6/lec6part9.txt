So in the process what may happen is that when the software is finally built, the users
may find that it does not meet their requirements. In such a situation it is probably a good
idea to develop the software in parts or in smaller increments and then release them and
get the feedback of the user. So there may be different approaches rather than using a
strictly linear waterfall model in such situations. Waterfall model is also considered very
documentation-heavy, what it means is that too much documentation is being produced
as part of the project. This may not be really necessary in all types of projects. So other
models have been proposed in order to take care of some of the short comings or to
handle some specific situations in project development scenarios.
