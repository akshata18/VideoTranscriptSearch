Introduction to Software Engineering
Challenges, Process Models etc
(Part 2)
This is second lecture on introduction to software engineering. Let us start by
summarizing by what we saw in the first lecture. We understood the challenges in
developing the large software. We want to do it in given time, within given resources and
meet userâ€™s requirement. This is indeed very challenging. We then saw the benefits of
engineering approach which consists of defining different milestones, different stages in
the development and carrying out periodic review and having a well-defined
methodology for the development. Then we have talked about different types of software
processes. These are processes for development of software, for project planning and
management, for configuration management and then for managing the software
processes themselves, because they are not fixed and static. They keep changing. So any
large software development organization will need to invest time and resources in
keeping the software processes up to date and state of art.
