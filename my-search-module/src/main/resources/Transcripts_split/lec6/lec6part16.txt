So in this case we have development going on in cycles and as we go through the cycles
the different risk issues are addressed and more refinements are done to our strategies, to
the functionalities in the case of spiral model. So spiral model basically identifies risks at
every step and it identifies the ways of addressing those risks either by following the
prototyping methods, or going through simulations, or carrying out benchmarking.
So at every development step we will decide in what way we want to follow. It is
primarily a risk driven approach. The spiral model consists of different cycles. In each
cycle we try to address some risk element that we see. And we plan the development, in
order to identify ways of addressing that risk. So if we have a risk perception about what
kind of user interfaces we should build, then we do prototyping. If a user interface and
performance issues are quite well understood, then the risk may be just the development
risk. In that case we decide to follow the waterfall model.
