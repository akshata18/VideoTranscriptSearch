You can probably see it on any of the books. In each cycle the four quadrants basically
try to address what we mentioned earlier. They enumerate alternatives, and then they
evaluate those alternatives, try to identify the risks and build a development and carry out
evaluation for the next phase. So the spiral model addresses the different risks and can be
used in large projects where both the requirement risk is present and development risk is
present. We have seen these different development methodologies. We saw three or four
of them the waterfall model the prototype model. Now let us move on to another process
which is equally important and you are going to study this in more details. But at this
point i will only give an overview of the management process. As we said earlier, any
large project needs to be managed. We prepare a project plan and we then manage the
whole project according to that plan. So naturally the project management runs in parallel
to the whole development process. As the development is progressing we are having a
continuous management oversight.
So in the case of project management, we have primarily, activity of defining the project
plan. In the project plan we will identify different activities, resources, deliverables, and
timelines and so on. So once the plan is ready then we will monitor it and also control as
it progresses. A project plan indicates how the project will be executed. And there are
very important things we must understand about the planning. A project plan is
absolutely essential for successful completion of the project. Therefore we must
appreciate some of the points which are important in a project plan. The first is that if you
do not have a plan then there is no management. There is no question of doing any
management if the plan does not exist. Then without making any measurements, it is not
possible to prepare any plans.
