Then we defined a typical step in a software development process we identified that the
step will consist of some entry criteria, exit criteria, it will have some specific task to do,
it will take certain inputs, it will provide some outputs and also the step will be under
management control. So this is a very important definition of the typical step in the
software development process. Then we also saw characteristics of good processes. And
one of the most important characteristic was that it should be predictable, it should be
well defined, and it should be repeatable. This is primarily what we focused on in the first
lecture. And towards the end we began to look at the waterfall model for software
development. We briefly introduced this last time. We said that a waterfall model
consists of many steps organized in a linear order. So that one step produces the right
kind of outputs for the next step.
