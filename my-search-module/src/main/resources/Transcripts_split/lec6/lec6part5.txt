So the project plan is one deliverable, feasibility report is another deliverable. One of the
important deliverable is requirements document which is also called software
requirement specification or SRS for short. SRS is very important baseline and defines
the functions that the software will perform for us. Obviously the SRS comes from the
analysis step. The next step is the design document. It defines the different components of
the software and how they will be implemented. You may have a detailed design
document. This document may specify individual units which will be implemented by
different programmers. We may have then specific test plans and expected test reports.
What it implies is that testing is not a on the fly kind of the task. Tests are planned well in
advance. They define what inputs will be given to the system and what outputs are
expected and whether the expected outputs are correct and the performance is as
expected. So test plans are made well in advance and as soon as the software is ready the
test plans are carried out and the workability of the software is demonstrated through the
test plans.
Of course the source code is an important deliverable and a deliverable which is in
executable form. Unlike other deliverables which are documents, this is a deliverable
which actually would be loaded on the computer and will be executed which actually
defines the software contents. And then we will also have different types of manuals or
documents which will be important for users and for administration of the software, for
installation of the software and so on.
