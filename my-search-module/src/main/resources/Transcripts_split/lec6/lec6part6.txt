So these different types of deliverables are identified from different stages or different
steps in the waterfall model. At the end of each step, if you recall we had said that every
step ends in a validation and verification step. Similarly in the waterfall model when we
move from one step to another there would be such reviews. Each step would end in a
review. These review reports are very important inputs for identifying whether the
development proceeded as per the plans, whatever the short comings whether the defects
will were detected and were properly addressed.
So review report is basically a catalog of how the development went through and it is an
important input to the development team as well as to the management. So these are
different deliverables. Many of them are important of which SRS is obviously one of the
baseline. Design document is also very important for future maintenance. Source code
definitely is important as it is executable and without this user manual, installation
manual, some administration manuals and the system cannot be effectively used. So as
you see here these different documents are essential part of the software. So software is
not just the source code but all this documents which accompany software. Now as we go
through this waterfall model and we perform the different steps, naturally we are
investing more effort. The diagram shows the cost effort distribution as we run through
the different steps in the waterfall model. So there are different steps are shown here.
