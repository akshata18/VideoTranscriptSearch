We generally maintain a list of features which have to be implemented in future releases
and we will come out with the versions in the future as we implement these features and
release the product. Each version will be analyzed and we will keep on updating our
featured list. So our third methodology is the iterative development. Finally we have
methodology called spiral model. In the spiral model we go through the development in
cycles and each cycle is divided into four quadrants. These quadrants as you see here are
named; the first quadrant, we tried to define the objectives alternatives what are the
constraints. So this is the starting point. Then we evaluate those alternatives and clearly
identify the risks. Now these risks may be pertaining to the interfaces, pertaining to
performances and so on. Based on these risks in the third quadrant of the cycle, we tried
to define what implementation will perform, and after the third in the fourth quadrant we
identify how we will plan the subsequent cycle.
