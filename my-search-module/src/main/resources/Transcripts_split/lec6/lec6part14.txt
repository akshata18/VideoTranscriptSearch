In the iterative development we define the initial scope and try to build a product which
will meet the initial scope that was identified and then release it quickly to get customer
feedback. Here iterative development is a good methodology for those software projects
which want to build products, which will be of use to many customers. So here we are
developing a product whose functionality may not be clearly known or there may be too
many features that we may want to provide. But we would rather like to release a product
quickly capture the market and get customer feedback. So this is the situation which is
ideal for iterative development.

Here the development takes place in multiple iterations and many versions of the
software may be released. You must be already familiar that some of the products such as
database products or packages like pay roll or accounting packages are available in the
market in versions. Basically the latest version represents additional features which have
been added from the previous version based on the requirements as perceived or based on
the customerâ€™s feedback. When we develop the initial version we may of course follow
any method. For example, we may follow the waterfall method for the initial version of
the product.
