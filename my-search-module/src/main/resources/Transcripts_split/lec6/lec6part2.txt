There is a linear or sequential order in which the different activities are performed. It
follows what we may call; “specify, design, build” sequence of activities, which should
appear to be quite obvious. What it really means is that, you cannot design something
which is not clearly specified. And if you have not done the design, naturally you cannot
build. This is like going to market without knowing what you want to buy. Naturally you
can’t buy them or you can’t compare different products. You need to have clear
specifications in mind before you go and want to buy something. Similarly when you
want to build something, you must define what needs to be build, what are the functions
that need to be performed, and then carry out a design which is efficient, effective. And
finally only when the design or the blue print is done, we start building. So we say that
this sequence of activities appear to be obvious and natural. This is what the waterfall
model tries to do.
Waterfall model produces many intermediate deliverables. There is a deliverable at every
step in the model. For each of these, proper standards have been defined. Most of these
deliverables are actually documents which have a standard format.
