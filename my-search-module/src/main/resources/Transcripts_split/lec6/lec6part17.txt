So in the case of spiral model, itâ€™s a risk driven model it allows us to use a mix of
different approaches, which may be specification oriented approaches like waterfall
model, or prototyping, or simulation. So unlike the incremental model where we try to
release the different versions in the features of the product, here in the spiral model as we
go through the different cycles, we try to address different risks. This model was
proposed by Boehm and here is a diagram which defined a few cycles of the development
process in the spiral model.
