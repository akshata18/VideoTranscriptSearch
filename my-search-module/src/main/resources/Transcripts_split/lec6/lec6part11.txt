Prototype might be either a working system or it may even be a paper prototype. So idea
in the case of prototype is to do a quick design and implementation and to illustrate the
approach or to illustrate the functionality to the user when these are clear. So we do not
want to spend too much time and effort as well as resources in building a prototype with
too much detail. We want to do a quick design and in fact those features which are clearly
known or clearly understood need not be implemented. In the case of prototype the focus
will be on what is unknown, or not properly understood. So prototype will be tuned as we
develop it. And when we try to satisfy customer needs, many iterations may be required
to incorporate the changes. Every time we complete the prototype we will evaluate it,
tune it and decide what needs to be done further.
Final product then would be built after the prototype is completed and is found to be
acceptable. This final product may be built using the standard waterfall type of
methodology, where we will go through the design, build and test life cycle. So here is
the diagram which illustrates possible steps in the prototyping model. We start by quickly
gathering the requirements. Then focus on those which are not clear and which need to be
experimented. Then we need a quick design, we build a prototype. While building the
prototype we may not care about doing too much documentation or look at the
maintainability issues or even consider performance issues even if they are not relevant.
Idea is to do a proof of the problem by demonstrating the unknown or un-understood.
