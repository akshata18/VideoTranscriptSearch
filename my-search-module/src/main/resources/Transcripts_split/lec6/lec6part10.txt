One of them is the prototyping model. In the prototyping model we try to build a
prototype rather than the final solution. And we do this especially when the customer is
either not aware of his requirements that what exactly he would like to how the software
would do for him. Or the developer is not sure about how to develop the software, how to
implement the business rules which are generally required for the software. So he may
not be certain about the best algorithms that need to be implemented in order to meet the
requirements. Or if efficiency is primary criteria, we are trying to let us say build
software which will give very high response time, then what kind of techniques one
should use in order to guarantee that kind of efficiency or response time. Now these may
be some of the unknowns either to the customer or to the developer.
In such situation we might rather decide to build a simple prototype and to find out either
the requirements or the techniques for implementation. So prototyping model is an
intermediate model or intermediate kind of a step in trying to define the requirements or
the solution approach. Usually, we will develop a prototype and we will do it in different
stages. And to begin with the prototype that we will build will be based on the user needs
as we currently understand them. Or the solution approaches as we understand them in
the beginning and we will review and refine them.
