If you have two algorithms and you have to decide, which one is better. You have to use
exactly the same platforms to do the comparison. Platform means both the hardware and
software environment. Because as you can imagine, different machines would make a
difference, in fact even the users who are working on that system at that particular point
would make a difference on the running time of an algorithm. It becomes very messy, if
you have to do it this way. Hence same hardware and software environments should be
used.
What we are going to do in the part of this course? In this very first lecture, we have to
develop the general methodology, which will help us to analyze running time of
algorithms. We are going to do it as follows: First we are going to develop a high level
description of an algorithm. The way of describing an algorithm and we are going to use
this description to figure out the running time and not to implement it to any system.
A methodology would help us to take into account of all possible input instances and also
it will allow us to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm in a way that it is independent
of the platform we are using.
