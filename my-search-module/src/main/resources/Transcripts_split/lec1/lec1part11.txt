Object specifies the type of the value returned by the particular method. You will see
more of this, when we come across more pseudo-code. How do we analyze algorithms?
First we identify what are the primitive operations in our pseudo-code. What is a
primitive operation? It is a low level operation. Example is a data movement in which I
do an assignment from one to another, I do a control statement which is a branch (if…
then …else) subroutine call or return. I do arithmetic operations or logical operations and
these are called as a primitive operation.
  Data movement (assign)
  Control (branch, subroutine call, return)
  Arithmetic an logical operations (e.g. addition, comparison)
In my pseudo code, I just inspect the pseudo code and count the number of primitive
operations that are executed by an algorithm. Let us see an example of sorting. The input
is some sequence of numbers and output is a permutation of the sequence which is in non
decreasing order. What are the requirements for the output? It should be in nondecreasing
order and it should be the permutation of the input.
