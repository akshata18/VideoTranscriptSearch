Instead of the assignment operator which is ‘=’ in java, I will use  and instead of the
equality operator, an equality relationship in java which is ‘= =’ the same in C, I will just
use ‘=’. I will declare methods with the algorithmic name and the parameter it takes.
Algorithm name (param 1, param2)
I will use all kinds of programming construct like if …then statement, if …then… [else]
statement, while … do, repeat …until, for … do and to index array I will say A[i], A [i,
j]. It should be clear in what it is doing.
I will use return when the procedure terminates and return value will tell about the value
returned by the particular procedure or a function. returns: return value When I have to
call a method, I will specify that with the name of the method and the argument and the
object used. calls: object method (args)
