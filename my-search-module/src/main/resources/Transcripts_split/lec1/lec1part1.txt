Hope you are all familiar with certain data structures, an array or a list. In this course you
will be seeing a lot of data structures and you will see how to use them in various
algorithms. We will take a particular problem, try to solve it and in the process develop
data structures. The best way of organizing the data, associated with that problem. What
is an algorithmic problem? An algorithmic problem is essentially, that you have a certain
specifications of an input and specify what the output should be like. Here is one
specification. A sorted, non decreasing sequence of natural numbers of non-zero, finite
length. For example:
  1,20,908,909,100000,1000000000
  3.
This is a completely specified input. Above are the two examples of input, which meets
the specification and I have not given any output specification.
What is an instance? A sorted, non-decreasing sequence of natural numbers of non-zero,
finite length forms an instance. Those two examples are the instances of the input. You
can have any possible number of instances that may take sequence of sorted, nondecreasing
numbers as input.
