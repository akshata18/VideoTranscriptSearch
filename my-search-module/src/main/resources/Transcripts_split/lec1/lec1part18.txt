On an average what would you expect? In the best case you have to compare only against
one element and in the worst case you have to compare about j elements. In the average
case it would compare against half of those elements. Thus it will compare with
2
j , even
when the summation of
2
j where j goes from 2 to n, this will be roughly by
2
4
n and it
behaves like n2 . This is what I mean by the best, worst and average case. I take the size of
input, suppose if I am interested in sorting n numbers and I look at all possible instances
of these n numbers.
