The worst case is the measure of interest in which we will be working with. Asymptotic
analysis is the kind of thing that we have been doing so far as n and n2 and the goal of
this is to analyze the running time while getting rid of superficial details.
We would like to say that an algorithm, which has the running time of some constant
times n2 squared is the same as an algorithm which has a running time of some other
constant times n2 ,because this constant is typically something which would be dependent
upon the hardware that your using.
3n2 = n2
In the previous example 1 c , 2 c and 3 c would depend upon the computer system, the
hardware, the compiler and many factors. We are not interested to distinguish between
such algorithms. Both of these algorithms, one which has the running time of 3n2 and
another with running time n2 have a quadratic behavior. When the input size doubles the
running time of both of the algorithm increases four fold.
That is the thing which is of interest to us. We are interested in capturing how the running
time of algorithm increases, with the size of the input in the limit. This is the crucial point
here and the asymptotic analysis clearly explains about how the running time of this
algorithm increases with increase in input size within the limit.
