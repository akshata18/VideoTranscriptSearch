Here is an example of pseudo code and you might have seen this in earlier courses also.
What is this algorithm doing? This algorithm takes an array A, which stores an integer in
it and it is trying to find the maximum element in this array. Algorithm array Max (A, n)
The above mentioned example is not a program, because the syntax is wrong. But it is a
pseudo code which is a mixture of natural language and some high-level programming
concepts.
I am going to use a for loop, do loop, if-then-else statement and a while loop. But I will
not bother about whether there should be a semicolon or a colon, because they are
required for the compiler. But for our understanding, what the program is doing is clear.
In the beginning it keeps track of the maximum variable in a variable called current max
which is initialized to the first element of the array. Current Max  A [0] Then it is
going to run through the remaining element of the array, compare them with the current
maximum element. If the current maximum element is less than the current element, then
it would update the current max. A[i] becomes the new max and then when the loop
terminates we would just return current max.
If current Max < A[i] then current Max  A[i]
return current Max
It is a very simple algorithm but just with this pseudo-code, you are able to understand
what it is doing. This will not run on any computer since it is the pseudo-code, but it
conveys the idea or the concepts.
