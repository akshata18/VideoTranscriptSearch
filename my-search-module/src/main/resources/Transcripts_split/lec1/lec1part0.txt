Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
Welcome to data structures and algorithms. We are going to learn about some basic
terminologies regarding data structures and the notations that you would be following in
the rest of this course. We will begin with some simple definitions. An algorithm is an
outline of the steps that a program or any computational procedure has to take. A
program on the other hand is an implementation of an algorithm and it could be in any
programming language. Data structure is the way we need to organize the data, so that it
can be used effectively by the program.
