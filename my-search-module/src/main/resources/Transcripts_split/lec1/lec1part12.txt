Any set of numbers which are in non-decreasing order does not make an output.
Algorithm should sort the numbers that were given to it and not just produce the
sequence of numbers as an increasing order. Clearly the running time depends upon,
number of elements (n) and often it depends upon how sorted these numbers are. If they
are already in sorted order then the algorithm will not take a long time. It also depends
upon the particular algorithm we use. The running time would depend upon all these
things. The first sorting technique we use is the one that you have used very often.
Let us say when you are playing game of cards.
