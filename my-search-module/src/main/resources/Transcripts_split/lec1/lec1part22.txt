For some algorithms worst case occurs fairly often. For many instances the time taken by
the algorithm is close to the worst case. Average case essentially becomes as bad as the
worst case. In the previous example that we saw, the average case and the worst case
were n2 . There were differences in the constant but it was roughly the same. The average
case might be very difficult to compute, because you should look at all possible instances
and then take some kind of an average. Or you have to say like, when my input instance
is drawn from a certain distribution and the expected time my algorithm will take is
typically a much harder quantity to work and to compute with.
