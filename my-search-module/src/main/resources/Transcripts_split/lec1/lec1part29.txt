(Refer Slide Time: 41.34)
It is an algorithm and let us compute the running time. This is one step. It is executed for
i number of times and initially i take a value from 0,1,2,3 and all the way up to n-1. This
entire thing is done n times. This gives you the total running time of roughly n2 .
a  a+ X[j]
This one step is getting executed n2 times and this is the dominant thing. How many
times the steps given below are executed?
A[i]  a/ (j+1)
a  0 These steps are executed for n times. a  a + X[j] But the step mentioned above
is getting executed roughly for some constant n2 times. Thus the running time of the
algorithm is O ( n2 ). It is a very simple problem but you can have a better solution.
