(Refer Slide Time: 27:08)
It may be infinitely many, again it is not clear about how to do that. What is worst case?
The worst case is defined as the maximum possible time that your algorithm would take
for any instance of that size. In the slide 27:08, all the instances are of the same size. The
best case would be the smallest time that your algorithm takes and the average would be
the average of all infinite bars. That was for the input for 1size of size n, that would give
the values, from that we can compute worst case, best case and the average case. If I
would consider inputs of all sizes then I can create a plot for each inputs size and I could
figure out the worst case, best case and an average case. Then I would get such a
monotonically increasing plots. It is clear that as the size of the input increases, the time
taken by your algorithm will increase. Thus when the input size becomes larger, it will
not take lesser time.
