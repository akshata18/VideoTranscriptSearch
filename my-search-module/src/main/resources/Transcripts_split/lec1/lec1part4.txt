But these are the only two things we will be considering in this course. We would be
spending more time on analyzing the running time of an algorithm and we will also spend
some time on analyzing the space. We would be interested in the efficiency of
algorithms, as a function of input size.
Clearly you can imagine that, if I have a small input and my algorithm or a program
running on that input will take less amount of time. If the input becomes 10 times larger,
then the time taken by the program may also increase. It may become 10, 20 or 100
times. It is this behavior of increase in the running time, with the increase in the size of
input would be of our interest.
Let us see the slide.
