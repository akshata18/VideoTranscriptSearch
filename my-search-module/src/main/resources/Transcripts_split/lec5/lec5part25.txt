So, what about, but then there is a notion of a complete Bipartite Graph. What is a
complete Bipartite Graph? So, complete bipartite Graph means... So, we should be able
to group the vertices into two groups such that. So, so they... So, let say this is A, and

this is B, and then whenever I have an edge x is vertex here, and whenever I have vertex
y here, then they will be an edge here.
In other words, all the pairs with one of one from A and one from B will form an edge.
So, usually we will we will show it like putting. So, say thick sorry. So, we can show it
like a selecting. So, like these all the edges are there. So, we can we can indicated like
this, all the all the possible edges between A and B are there; this is called a complete
Bipartite Graph. So, notation for instance suppose there are m vertices in this A side, n
vertices in the this B side; then we will call it K n m, this is the notation for that.
Remember the complete Bipartite Graph is K n with n vertices, here this K n m - n for
the number of vertices here sorry. So, let me say K m n or yes as we wish K m n.

So, this is a complete bipartite Graph.
