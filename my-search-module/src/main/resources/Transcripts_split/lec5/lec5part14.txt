Now, one word which we always use as isomorphism. This is for instance, we can we
sometimes say that there is, a path on 5 vertices is a sub Graph of G, is essentially a path
on 5 vertices is isomorphic to Sub Graph of the given Graph like that. So, therefore, it is
I will just mention this word.
So, an isomorphism from a simple Graph G to a simple Graph H is a Bijection, such that
whenever u and u, v is an edge of G, then the corresponding pair f of u comma f of v is
an edge of H. So, to understand this thing we can take an example.
