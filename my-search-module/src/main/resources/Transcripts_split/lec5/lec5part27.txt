So, let us take an example to explain this. So, so consider this Graph - simple Graph. Say
simple Graph, now I am asking for a collection of vertices such that, every edge has one
of the end points in this set. For instance, let me show an example. So, so I will let me
take this vertex, and this vertex, and this vertex. Now, you take any edge. Suppose, this
edge; it is one red end point. So, this edge it is one of the in fact, both the end points are
red. Here another edge, it is one of the end points as red. So, another edge, so one end
point is red, and another edge one end point is red.
So, every edge is such that, it has at least one end point as red. So, then these 3 vertices,
the set of these 3 vertices, red vertices called a vertex cover of this Graph. So, interesting
way of explaining it is suppose you consider museum. So, museum say let me draw say
something like this.
