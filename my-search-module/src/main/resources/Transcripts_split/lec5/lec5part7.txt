Now, the next thing is two notions: Sub graphs, induced Sub Graph. So, given a Graph
G, we say that another Graph H is a Sub Graph of H. If the vertex set of H is a subset of
the vertex set of G that is what a we mention. So, V of H is a subset of V of G, and the
edge set of H is a subset of the edge set of G. Thus next statement is just to say that the
edge set means we are not just naming, we are just using the same name, but the
assignment of a vertices to the each edge is the same G and H. For instance rather than
explaining like this, it is better to draw a Graph ensure.
