Next, so, what about the cycle on n vertices. So, suppose if we consider the cycle on n
vertices, what should be the cardinality of a minimum vertex cover. So, here I have
drawn a cycle on 7 vertices. So, let us let us make it 8, let us make it 8 sets cycle on eight
vertices. So now, you can easily see that. So, vertex cover... So, I am marking vertex
cover here. So 1, 2, 3, 4 this is a vertex cover; 4 vertices is enough to cover all the edges,
if we take any edge one of the end point is a red.
Now, the question... So, for instance if this is a cycle on n vertices C n with n even, then
it is clear that n by 2 vertices will be enough we can take alternate one here, then next
here, then next here like that. So, n by 2 will be enough. But then the question is it
possible to do with less than n by 2 vertices. So, without much difficult we can see that it
is not possible, because if we look at each vertex, each red vertex here; it is only
covering two vertices, because the degree of this Graph, degree means the number of
edges incident on the vertex is called the degree. Degree of this Graph is. So, degree of
these vertices only 2, so degree of these vertices only 2.
So therefore, so each vertex is covering only taking care of only two edges. So, together
n by 2 vertices can take care of only n edges. So, for instance if we if we could do with n

by 2 minus 1 that will take care of only n by 2 minus 2 edges. So, the remaining 2 edges
will be left and covered. So therefore, n by 2 is a must. Similarly, if we consider suppose
if n is an odd number, then if you can easily see that you will need n by 2 seal right,
because if we have n by 2 say floor also. So, each vertex will cover only 2. So, that will
be less than m.
