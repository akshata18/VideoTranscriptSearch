So, so let us take this Graph.
(No audio from 16:33 to 16:49)
Right 1, 2, 3, 4. So, another Graph I can draw like this; let us this be G 1, and then let let
me draw another Graph this is like this. So, first look these two since to be very different
Graphs, but in fact this one can be map to these things a 1. So, this correspond to this say
4 can be map to this one, say and 3 can be map to this thing; another this triangle comes

here, and these two can be map to this. sorry you can be map to this. This 2, 2 1, 2 1
there is an edge; 2 3, 2 3, there is an edge, 2 4 this edge you can see.
So, you can see that, whenever there is an edge between say I and J here, the
corresponding edge is present here also; otherwise, if there is a no edge then that edge ((
)) there. So, this is the notion of isomorphism.
