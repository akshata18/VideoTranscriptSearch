So, it is a much easier to represent a Graph by a drawing; so, it can be like this say. Let
us say I am drawing, if these vertex sets, vertex sets; this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of
the set of vertices, and the edges can be say e 1, e 2, e 3, e 4, e 5 say. So here, the edge e
1 is associated with the two vertices 1 and 5. It is call the end points of the edge e 1, the
edge e 2 is associated with the 5 and 2, the end points of e 2 like that. Now, what kind of
edges is possible? So, it is not necessary that the two vertices associated with an edge the
end points or distinct to vertices (( )) it can be like this, the two vertices associated with
this edge say e 6 is 2 and 2.
So, it is called a loop, because both the end points are same. Now, it is also possible that
there are many edges, which are associated to the same pair of vertices. For instance it is
possible to have several edges say e 2, say e 7, e 8; such that the two vertices associated
with them are same, the same 5 and 2. So, then we call this is a multiple edges here
between this two vertices. The when we denote have any loop or multiple edge in a
Graph, then we say that the Graph is a simple Graph. It is also possible that our vertex
set is infinite, the edge set is infinite, but if you assume that both the vertex set and the
edge set is finite. Then we say that it is is a finite Graph.
Usually in this course, most of the time we will be taking about finite Graphs, and a
simple Graphs, if at all we are talking about non-simple Graphs will be explicitly
mentioning that or if we talk about infinite Graph will be explicitly mentioning that.
