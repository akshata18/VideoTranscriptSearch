So, so we... So, that it is like this for instance m vertices here, n vertices here. So, is a
bipartite Graph, this is an independence set, this is an independent set nothing inside, it
no edges there. And then for instance, we we can say it look like this. So, all the edges of
there in here, all the edges are there from this to this right. We have to cover all these
edges. So, what is the minimum? So, if you if you see that suppose if I take all these
vertices, then definitely it will cover all these edges, because every edge has to have at
least one end point in this side or if I take all the vertices from this side, that is also
enough.
So, since we are looking for a minimum vertex cover. So, we will take this smaller side,
if m is less than equal to n. So, we can go for this thing; this will be this side for instance
this is A and this is B. Then A will be a vertex cover, but is it minimum that is a
question. So, can we do in with less than m vertices? So, it look it is not possible,
because suppose we can do. And then so, if we do with less than m vertices; definitely
there are a vertex here, say x which is not part of the vertex cover, x is not part of the
vertex cover.
Similarly, they should be a vertex here y, which is which is not part of the, because this
is more than n is more than m. So, we have taken less than m vertices. So, the should be
a y. So, and also because it is a complete bipartite Graph, there is an edge between these
two - this edge. Whoâ€™s going to cover them. So, edge between. So, x y they should be an

edge between them, whose going to cover that edge. So, it is not possible to cover all the
edges of this complete Bipartite Graph K m n with less than m vertices.
