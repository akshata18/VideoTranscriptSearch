So, we can take some simple examples like. For instance I can consider a cycle. So, is
this a sorry. So, let say consider this cycle, this cycle. So, now, how do I partition it into
two collections, such that such that each collection induces and independent set. For
instance, I can say this I will put it in one part, this I will put it in same part this; so, I
will put it in the same part. And the other one set this, this and this I will put in the other
part. So, these black vertices form induce and independence set in these Graphs;
similarly, these induce and independent sets in this Graph.
So, every edge in this Graph is going from a red vertex in the black vertex. So, for
instance you could have grouped. So, if I number it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I could have
placed 1, 3 and 5 my black vertices on this side. And the red vertices say 2, 4 sorry; 2, 4
and 6 on this side on the edges will be1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1. So, the edges always going from
one side to the other. So, this is one way of viewing the Bipartite Graph. So, a Graph is a
bipartite Graph if I do these things right in a Graph. So, is it possible that any Graph is
Bipartite.
