So, we can. So that suppose, if you remove a maximum a sorry, vertex cover - any vertex
cover from the Graph what will happen. So, if you remove the set of vertices that form a
vertex cover from the Graph what will happen. The remaining vertices that you see is
going to be an independent set; why is it so, because if there is any edge in this in the
remaining collection of vertices, then this edge will not be covered by anybody, because
what we removed was a vertex cover. So, the one of the end point of this edge has to be
in that. So, if you remove a vertex cover from the Graph what we are left with this an
independent set. So therefore, we can see that, if I remove a minimum vertex cover, then
what remains - the n minus the cardinality of the minimum vertex cover, number of
vertices form an independent set. So, that is what we have written here.
So therefore, our maximum independent set cardinality has to be even greater than this.
So, alpha is greater than equal to n minus MVC of G, that is what.
