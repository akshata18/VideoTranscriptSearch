So let us consider some simple examples like. So, consider a tree. So, this is a tree is this
a bipartite Graph for instance simple; yeah this is a bipartite Graph, because we can place
say this in one side, and then immediate children of that can be placed in the other side
right in the other part; and then the children of this can be placed in the other part like
this. So for instance, if you want see it in these two part form. So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 then I can
place one here, and then 2 and 3 should go to the other side, 2 and 3 should go to the
other side, these 2 vertices; and 4 and 5, so it neighbors of two should come to this side 4
and 5. So you can see that, so by extending this argument you can see that any tree can
be placed like this, on 2 2 sides.
So, without any edge appearing in this side or without any edge appearing in this side
right. So, all the edges will go from one side to other; the trees are like that, trees are
Bipartite Graphs. Now so we show that, some cycles are Bipartite; it is true that every
cycle is a bipartite Graph.
