Suppose suppose there is a vertex cover with n minus 2 vertices, then there are 2 vertices
say let us say x and y in the Graph, such that it is not in this vertex cover. Because we
have in the vertex cover, we have only n minus 2 vertices, there are 2 more vertices let x
and y be the two vertices. So, because it is a complete Graph between x and y, we do
have an edge. Neither x nor y is in the vertex cover we have selected. So, who is
covering this edge right?
So therefore, if we have only n minus 2 vertices in the set we have selected, it cannot be
a vertex cover. So, the number of vertices in a the vertex cover of complete Graph is, at
least n minus 1 and its n minus 1 is enough. Therefore, for complete Graph the
cardinality the minimum vertex cover is n minus 1.
Now, let us consider another example. So, what about a complete Graph on complete
Graph K m n on, so with m vertices on one side, complete bipartite; there is not complete
Graph.
