So, so here for instance it was like this. So, suppose this is I draw a Graph like this now,
suppose you you can mark some vertices; as this is the minimum vertex cover here, let us
MVC. So, here we have n minus cardinality of MVC number of vertices. This is going to
be an independent set, this is independent set. So, the biggest independent set has to be
even bigger than this possibly even bigger than this, that is why we say alpha of G has to
be greater than or equal to n minus MVC.
