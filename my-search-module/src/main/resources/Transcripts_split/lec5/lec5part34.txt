That that will give that introduces this notion of vertex cover. Now, let us consider
another parameter, it is called we have already talked about independent set. So, the
independent set means, if it is a subset of vertices such that if you take the induced Sub
Graph on this set of vertices, then what we do not see any edges in it. It is it is it is a
without any edges, then it is an independent set.
So, given a Graph G, we can ask what is a biggest independent set in it. What is a biggest
cardinality - maximum cardinality of any independent set in it. So, that number the
biggest cardinality if an independent set in a Graph is a called the independents number
or stability number of G. And this famous parameter is the notation for these things is
alpha of G.
