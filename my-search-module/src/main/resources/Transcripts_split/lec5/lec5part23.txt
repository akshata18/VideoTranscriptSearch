So, we can consider this cycle for instance simpler cycle the triangle 3, it is called a
triangle. So, or 3 cycles C 3 is this a bipartite Graph. So, suppose this is a bipartite
Graph, then we should be able to place the vertices in two groups, in such a way that the
edges go from one side to the other. So, let say one is placed in this thing without lose of
generality this side. Now, if one is placed here, this 3 and 2 should be on the other side. 2
and 3 should be on the other side, because there is an edge between 1 and 3, 1 and 2, but
then between 3 and 2, there is an edge it has to come here. So, this will become a
problem right. So, this will be flop.
So therefore, this triangle cannot be a bipartite Graph. So, what kind of cycles are not
Bipartite. So, with some thought we can see that, every even cycle can be place like this,
but the odd cycles cannot place like this. So, you can try to place 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 vertex.
So, this 7 vertex C 7 can this be placed like this. So, it is not possible; for instance if I
place it in the first part, and then I will have to place this and this in the other part, and if
I then I will have to place this in the first part, and then I will have to place this in the red
part, this also has to be in the red part, there is an edge between these two red parts. So,
therefore, these cannot be a bipartite Graph. So, this is part a bipartite Graph is.
