That means, suppose we can consider this simple Graph. So, here there are 6 vertices in
this Graph. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, between 1 and 2 there is a path, between 4 and 6 there
is a path, but suppose I consider the vertex 1 and the vertex 4, then I do not see any path path means, if I start from here and then follow an edge, and then I cannot reach here.
So, this is a disconnected graph. Now, how do I make for instance if, this has to be
became a connected graph. So, for instance I can put this edge here. So, then this
becomes a connected graph; that means, if I start from any vertex, I can reach any other
vertex using a path, path is like this. So, this is the notion of the connected (( )).
In this lecture, I am not going to tell all the definitions as in a text book, because that will
be very boring for a class. So, what I will do is I will introduce the notions which are
necessary to understand the things as and when it is required. But it also advisable that,
this students can go through the introductory chapter of one of these text books which I
mentioned earlier say, the the once which I mentioned earlier for instance this one.
