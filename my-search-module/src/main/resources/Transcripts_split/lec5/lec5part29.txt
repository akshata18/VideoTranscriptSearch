Now to get familiar with the what is a vertex cover, we can ask the some some take
some examples and see, what are the what is the cardinality of the minimum vertex cover

in those Graphs. For instance our first Graph, the complete Graph K n what is a
cardinality of the minimum vertex cover in a complete Graph.
So, it is... So, so easy to say that for instance if there are ten vertices, and if I just take
one vertex, this one vertex cannot cover all the edges right. So, how many we will need
to cover.
