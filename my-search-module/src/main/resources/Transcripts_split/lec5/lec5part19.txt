The next notion I want as that is a Bipartite Graph, we say that a Graph G is bipartite; if
it is vertex set is the union of two disjoint, possibly empty independence sets called a
partite set of G. So, a subset... So, what do I mean by independent sets. If I if I consider a
subset of a Graph, and look at the induced Sub Graph of it. And if you (( )) any edge in
it, then it is called an independence set of that Graph.
