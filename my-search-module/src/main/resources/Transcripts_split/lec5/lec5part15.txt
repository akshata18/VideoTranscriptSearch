So, here let us let us draw a Graph. So, this is our G here; 1, 2, 3, 4. So, now, consider
another Graph like this. So, looks very different, but then we say that these two Graphs
are isomorphic. Because it it will name it like this a, b, c, d. Because I can map vertex.
So, the function f will map 1 to a. So, that is one will be map to, a a to can be map to can
be map to b, 3 can be map to, c and 4 can be map to d, this is a function f. So, as we
wanted. So, whenever there is an edge; that means, 1, 4 is an edge. So, the corresponding
vertices a and d, between a and d there is an edge. So, we say that if. So, for similarly 1,
3 there is no edge. So, between a and c the corresponding vertices here, a and c there is
no edge here.
So, thus therefore, we say that there is an isomorphic. These two Graphs are isomorphic.
Essentially; that means, we have a same Graphs, but maybe we have drawn a differently
something like that. And so we can take another example for instance.
