So, for instance we can consider in this Graph for instance, we can consider this say, say
some of these vertices say this one, this one, this one, this one. So, these 4 vertices. So, if

I consider the induced Sub Graph on these 4 vertices will just get something like this
right, right they want any edge on it right. So, therefore, this this will be an empty sorry
this is this is an independent set this is called an independent set of this. So, we say that
the Graph G is bipartite, if we can partition the vertex set of G into two groups; such that,
the each of this collection group is inducing and independent set in the Graph.
