So, with some thought we can understand that we will have to take. So, if we take n
minus 1 vertices from the, from the n vertices. Then we can cover all the edges; cover the
edges means. So, the all the edges will have at least one end point in it. For instance, so
let us say this complete Graph, this is the K for the complete Graph on four vertices.
Now, if I take say if I take this one, this one, and this one; then you see that all the edges
are covered, it is very easy to verify.
But now the question is it possible that. So, the from this thing what do we get, there
exist vertex cover of cardinality 3; that means, say n minus 1 for a complete Graph on n
vertices, but is it possible that we can cover all the edges of a complete Graph on n
vertices by less than n minus 1, what if it is possible some clever way of selection.
But some thought will reveal to us that; it is not possible, because suppose we can do that
suppose we can do that, using just n minus 2.
