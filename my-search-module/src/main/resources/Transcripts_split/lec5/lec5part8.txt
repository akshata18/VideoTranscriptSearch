So, for instance let us consider this simple example.
(No audio from 07:48 t0 07:55)
This is called as cycle cycle Graph C n. So, the cycle this is called a cycle Graph. The
cycle on n vertices C n. And. So, suppose we collect these vertices using red, let say
these vertices and then take some of the edges here; so, this one, this one. So, here the
vertex set these red color vertices now is a subset of the vertex set of the original Graph
C n, and the edge set is also a subset of the original Graph C n. So, then this is a this
looks like this; this is a Sub Graph of the original Graph.
Let us may be you can consider little more complicated, some little more complicated
figure. So, let us say consider this Graph. Now, if I consider these vertices. So, and this
edges, this is a sub Graph. So, this black edges and these vertices form a Sub Graph of
this big Graph; and so, and then the next is a notion called induced Sub Graph. What is
an induced Sub Graph? So, the induced Sub Graph means, if we select few a vertices - a
subset of G and then look at the edge set for instance we can consider our earlier earlier
example.
So, this was here we selected the vertex set, and this is what we got is something like this
red red, this is called a path Graph say. So, something like this is a path Graph on three
vertices, and sees when I consider these vertices all the edges of C n, the original Graph
which have both end points in the selected collection of vertices, is there in the sub
Graph also. Then this is called an induced Sub Graph.
