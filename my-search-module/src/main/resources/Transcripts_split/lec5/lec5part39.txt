Similarly, what will happen if I remove an independent, suppose this Graph and I I mark
an independent, suppose this is an independent set. Now, let us take the biggest
independent set, independent set maximum and remove it. So, clearly what remains here
is going to be a VC - vertex cover why because any edge is going to be like this only, it
is not possible to have an edge like this. So, any edge is a has at least one of these end
points in this part. So, it is a vertex cover.
So, the minimum vertex cover has to be even smaller than this. So, we get cardinality of
the minimum vertex cover is less than equal to the number of vertices minus alpha of G.
This is this cardinality is alpha of G, because it is the cardinality of the maximum
independent set. So, from the earlier slide we see, this can be rearranged to right
cardinality of MVC is greater than or equal to n minus alpha of G; here in the other side,
we can see that cardinality is less than equal to n minus MVC.
