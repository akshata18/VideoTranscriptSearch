Now I can search for example IIT specification number wise where each specification
will give the different specifications for the computer systems or you can have the search
through vendor name or through brand name or processor name or a combination of this.

For an example let us say I actually click on specification number wise and submit this
then I can actually see all the specifications IIT has in this particular case. There are ten
specifications in this case let us say I actually choose the fourth specification and submit
that specification.
