processes and transaction in my database system will be able to actually access and do
the necessary processing here. Now let us understand what are the key challenges are
conceptual thing that we should be understanding in building this. Now for a minute let
us understand this application, what we have as different entities in these applications and
how do actually store this data or create my tables and my data and then how do actually

and store the database underneath server for me.
