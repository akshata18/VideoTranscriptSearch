For example I can see here there is a company InfoTech limited which quoted for the
specification 4 at 25000 rupees for G 33 chipset. For P 33 P 35 chipset actually it is
available at 25500. So what this gives is actually all the vendors and whoever has quoted
for the system and they prove to be in the rate contract and what are available in this rate
contract can be searched by using this. One can in fact do a little, better search by saying
for example if you want to actually take a specific processor or a CPU clock speed and
also a vendor name then you can actually submit this quote here.
