Now you can say a canonical electronics private limited is a vendor name and I want
clock speed 2.8 and I want to see all specifications matching these two requirements then
I will basically submit this. I get one specification matching this requirement which says
that this is the available system for me in the rate contract which I probably put order if
that satisfies my requirement. Now to understand what is happening here as you can see
here we need to get this information organized in the back end database and have this
information stored properly into our database system.
