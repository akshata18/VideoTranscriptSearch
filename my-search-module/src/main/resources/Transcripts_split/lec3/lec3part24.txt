For example, let me read for you an excerpt from the spirit update. Just a little RAT,
Spirit spent the last few salts investigating pot of gold including a successful grind with
the Rock Abrasion Tool that is what RAT is, a RAT is a Rock Abrasion Tool. So, what
spirit is doing is using a rock abrasion tool and getting samples of rocks from the surface
of Mars and it is trying to find out what chemicals are present in the rock. So, one of the
objectives of this mission is to find out whether there is water in Mars.
In fact these Mars Rovers have been able to trace the presence of water from the rock
samples in Mars. Then opportunity is going from Virginia to London. These are different
locations defined on the mars’ surface and opportunity is currently in a crater called the
endurance crater and it is abrading and examining rocks. This image shows the area
inside endurance crater that opportunity has been examining. The Rover is investigating
the distinct layers of rock that make up this region. And this image taken by Rover
highlights the nodular nuggets that cover the rock that has been named the Pot of Gold.
These nuggets appear to stand on the end of stalk like features.
The surface of the rock is dotted with fine scale pits. And there are so many other news
about these two Space rovers. The Spirit rover is currently exploring a range of marsh
and hills that took two months to reach. It is finding curiously eroding rocks that may be
new pieces to the puzzle of the region’s past. Spirit’s twin opportunity is also negotiating
sloped ground examining exposed rock layers inside a crater informally named
endurance.
