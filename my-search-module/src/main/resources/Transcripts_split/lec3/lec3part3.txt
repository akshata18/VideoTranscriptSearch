The way we will do it is, we will look at the different components of intelligence and for
each of these we will discuss ways of solving these problems. And then, depending on
the functionality of the system that you wish to construct or engineer you can put together
some of these solutions to get the full system. After you have taken the scores you should
be able to appreciate the role of problem solving, the role of natural language processing,
the role of computer vision etc in understanding human intelligence from a computational
point of view.
Some more points on objectives of the course:
On taking this course you should be able to formulate certain types of problems as state
space search problems and you should learn the efficient methods to solve them
depending upon the characteristics of the problem space, you should be able to write
programs that play games particularly two player games, you should be able to use
learning to find patterns in data to find rules from data, you should be able to build expert
systems for different diagnostic and other purposes.
