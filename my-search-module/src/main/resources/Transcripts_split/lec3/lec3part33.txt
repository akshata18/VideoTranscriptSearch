But there are many limitations to what AI cannot do yet. AI systems currently cannot
understand natural language robustly. AI systems cannot surf the web yet or interpret an

cannot construct plans in all sorts of dynamic real time domains in general. And AI
systems do not yet exhibit true autonomy and intelligence.
