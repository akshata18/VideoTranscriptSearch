So strong AI proponents want to develop systems that are completely intelligent and that
can do things fully using their own intelligence. Such systems can be human like can be
non-human-like but rational. When AI was conceived in the 1950s and 1960s there was a
huge optimism about AI and there was a prediction that very soon AI systems will be
able to overtake humans and able to everything that a human can do and can do them
much better and do tasks that humans cannot do within a short time.
However, such optimism has been ill founded and this was partly the reason why some
people lost faith in the techniques of AI. But now after research into AI has taken place
for over 50 years now we are in a position to understand and appreciate the true difficulty
of the different problems that AI face. And we known what we can aim to solve now and
what is more difficult and we will need different techniques, different hardware and
different paradigms to be able to solve.
Weak AI unlike strong AI deals with the creation of some Artificial Intelligence that
cannot truly reason and solve problems but act as if it were intelligent. So the proponents
of weak AI claim that machines which have been suitably programmed can simulate
human cognition, appear to behave intelligently, appear to do tasks well and intelligently
without really having the same intelligence or understanding as humans possess.
Therefore, strong AI really deals with machines that really have mental states that think,
reason, understand their behavior whereas weak AI is involved in simulating human
behavior or simulating intelligent behavior without really claiming that the reasoning
process behind it is intelligent.
