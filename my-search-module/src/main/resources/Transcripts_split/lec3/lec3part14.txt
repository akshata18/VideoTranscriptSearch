Now, if the interrogator cannot reliably distinguish between a human answerer and a
computer answerer then we can say that the computer system possesses Artificial
Intelligence. This is the test devised by Turing to find out whether the machine has been
able to come up with a right amount of intelligence to match human intelligence in
answering questions. Now let us look at typical AI problems.
Intelligent entities or agents need to be able to do different types of tasks. There are some
tasks which are mundane tasks that we do as a matter of fact in out daily life and there are
some tasks that we consider intelligent like solving difficult mathematical problems,

playing games of chess in an expert fashion and other activities which intelligent people
can do well. Now, examples of mundane tasks are planning route. Suppose you want to
go to here from the market and you plan a path along which you will go. Or you want to
go from here to let us a say a particular place in Delhi and you have to plan your journey
and plan your path. Something that we do all the time is trying to recognize objects or
recognize faces of people, this requires vision.
Thirdly, we communicate with each other through natural language. Fourthly, we
navigate around obstacles on the street. So these are the tasks that we do routinely. In fact
most animals do this task routinely. And then there are expert tasks like medical
diagnosis which are only the doctor or the expert in the field does. And mathematical
problem solving can be done effectively only by good mathematicians.
