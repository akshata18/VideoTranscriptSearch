On the one hand we have thought or reasoning versus behavior and on the other hand we
have human like performance versus ideal performance. So there are systems that think
like humans. For example, we will discuss the famous Turing test which was devised by
Alan Turing where the system which passed the Turing test would be a system that
behaves like a human or thinks like a human. The second definition is systems that think
rationally.

The school of thought were different philosophers, mathematicians and computer
scientists who have worked on logic and laws of thought believe in this approach.
Thirdly, there are systems that act like humans. Cognitive scientists look at the properties
of systems that act like humans and finally we have the definition systems that act
rationally or systems that act in the best possible manner. And for this we have the
approach of constructing a rational agent an agent which acts rationally. Alan Turing
considered by many to be the father of AI devised the Turing test.
In the Turing test this is the experimental set up that is devised. There will be a closed
room and in this closed room there will be a being which may be a computer and it may
be a human. There is an interrogator outside the room. The interrogator does not know
whether the being inside the room is a computer or a human. So what the interrogator
does is that the interrogator asks questions and the being inside the room processes these
questions and returns some answer and the interrogator on the left room receives the
answers on the screen.
Now the interrogator has to make out from the answers whether the being inside the room
is a computer or human. Now, if there is a computer inside the room the computer tries to
convince the interrogator that it is actually a human being in the way it answers to the
questions and it is the task of the interrogator to decide who is human.
