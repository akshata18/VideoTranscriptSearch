This is a system ALVINN which stands for Autonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural
Network. It was designed in 1989 by Dean Pomerleau at Carnegie Mellon University.
This system drove a car from the east coast to the west coast across United States of
America using computer control. And it drove completely autonomously for most of the
2850 miles. Only for 50 miles especially at exits to freeways etc the human driver took
charge. For 2800 miles the car drove it. And the idea behind the car is quite simple. In
front of the car is a camera which takes a picture of the road in front.
