For example, one may have a theory about how humans recognize faces. We do not know
how we recognize faces, how our brain recognizes faces, how we store all the different
faces or some of the many different faces that we have seen in our lifetime and how we

theories about how people recognize faces or how people solve different types of
problems. And some of these theories can be tested by building similar mechanisms
which are machine and testing how well the machines perform. Here I have outlined
some of the topics of AI.
