The goal of applied AI is to produce viable smart systems. For example, it will be nice to
have a security system that is able to recognize the faces of people who are permitted to
enter a particular building. There are certain applications which are useful to us and
applied AI aims to solve these applications intelligently, not necessarily to construct a
complete intelligent agent but an agent which is intelligent in doing a specific task.
For example, recognize people, detect credit card fraud, drive a vehicle autonomously. So
they take up specific tasks and develop systems that solve those tasks. Fourthly, cognitive
AI deals with the studies where computers are used to test theories about how the human
mind works. Cognitive scientists want to understand how humans act, how humans
behave, how humans think and these theories can be tested by building these theories into
machines and watching and testing how well the machines function using those theories.
