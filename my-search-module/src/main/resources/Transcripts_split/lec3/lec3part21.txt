In a machine translation if we could have immediate translations between people
speaking different languages that would be a remarkable feat and it has very wide ranging
economic and cultural implications. In the world today there are people speaking so many
different languages and we do not understand the languages of many other people. Even
in India as you know there are so many languages, there are more than 20 official
languages and I cannot understand the language of each Indian. So would it not it be nice
if we had a system which would do simultaneous machine translations so that we can
effortlessly understand each other.
Full machine translation is not yet there but there has been quite some progress in the
field of machine translation in a small way. For example, the US military is giving a
simpler one way translation device they are using this in Iraq. US forces are using the
Phraselator to communicate with injured Iraqi prisoners of war travelers at checkpoints
and for other peace keeping duties. Carnegie Mellon University is working on a system
called the speechlator for use in doctor patient interview.
