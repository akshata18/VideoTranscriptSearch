The instructional objectives of this course:
On taking this course you should b able to understand the role of basic knowledge
representation, how to represent our knowledge about the world and knowledge of
problem solving techniques and a knowledge of some of the learning methods in AI. And
we will see how these are used to solve different problems and to build a complete
intelligent system.
On taking this course you should be able to assess the applicability the strengths and
weaknesses of these methods of the different techniques that we discuss. We will discuss
the strengths of this method and situations where these methods can be applied to solve
different types of problems that require intelligence. You will learn how to develop
intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems.
