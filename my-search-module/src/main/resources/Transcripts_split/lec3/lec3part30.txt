In the core areas we talked about knowledge representation, reasoning, machine learning.
General algorithms: search, planning, constraint, satisfaction.
Perception: vision, natural language processing, robotics.
Applications: game playing, AI and education, distributed agents.
Uncertainty: probabilistic approaches, decision theory, reasoning with symbolic data.
These are some of the topic that people study in AI and in this course also we are going
to study most of these topics. Today successful AI systems operate in well defined
specific domains employing narrow or specialized knowledge.
