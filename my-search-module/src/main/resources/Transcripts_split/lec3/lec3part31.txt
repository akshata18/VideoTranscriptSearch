However, if you want to artifact a system that has general intelligence that can work
intelligently in any domain we need to have a lot of things. For example, such a system
must have common sense knowledge which is needed to function in open ended worlds.
We use such a huge amount of common sense knowledge or background knowledge to
do our tasks well. If we really start thinking and try to note them down then it is a huge
effort. There is an effort at Stanford University by Tog Lenat Guha and others called the
psyche project whose objective is to document all common sense knowledge so that one
can have a system that can use all these common sense knowledge for their reasoning.
Secondly, a general unconstrained AI system must be able to understand natural
language, in fact unconstrained natural language. Though there has been a lot of stride in
natural language understanding, then understanding unconstrained natural language in
general is a very difficult problem which will require a lot of expertise to solve
completely.
What can todayâ€™s AI systems do?

We have systems that can recognize faces, we have almost autonomous vehicles, our
natural language processing systems can do simple machine translation. Our expert
systems can do medical diagnosis in a narrow domain.
