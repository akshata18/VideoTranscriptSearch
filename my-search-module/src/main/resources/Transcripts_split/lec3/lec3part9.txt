Now, the term artificial is easy to understand but what is intelligence?
It is very difficult to define intelligence. Often we look at some people look at
intelligence as something that characterizes humans. If you take human beings to be
intelligent you can say Artificial Intelligence means having behavior which is like a
human. In fact there are two schools of thought here. Here an idea is to have a machine or
have a system that behaves like a human. Humans are not always completely intelligent
even though humans are very good. Actually pretty intelligent but all the time humans do
not behave intelligently.
So the other school of thought is that Artificial Intelligence concerns with intelligence
which is the ideal or the best behavior or the most rational behavior. It is the machine that
should behave in the best possible manner. There is another dichotomy in the definition.
When we talk about behavior what sort of behavior are we talking about?
There are two main types of behavior that people will like to talk about. Number one is
thinking, thinking intelligently, reasoning properly and intelligently in order to come up
with a solution. And the second approach is to talk about not thinking but acting how the
system actually acts or behaves. We can talk about intelligence as something which
characterizes humans or something that means behavior in the best possible manner or
behaving rationally.
Again we can talk about intelligence in thought or intelligence in action. So, based on this
criterion we can look at the different ways of defining AI. So we may look at thought
processing or reasoning versus behavior, we may look at human like performance versus

ideal rational performance. And this diagram shows the four different definitions that
emerge from these two dichotomous.
