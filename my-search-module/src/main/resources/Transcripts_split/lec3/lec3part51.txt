Before that people felt that a lot of things were possible by AI and we will soon have an
extremely intelligent computer. But the limitations to the computational power was
discovered when computational complexity was understood. In 1967 Feigenbaum and
others developed a general program which was demonstrated used to demonstrate and
interpret mass spectrum on organic chemical compounds.
In 1968 there was a very significant paper by Minsky and Papert which demonstrated the
limits of simple neural net. This paper had a tremendous negative effect in discouraging
the field of neural network for the time being. And later of course people realized that
there are ways of coming out of this problem. In 1969 SRI robot, Shakey in Stanford
demonstrated locomotion perception and problem solving.
