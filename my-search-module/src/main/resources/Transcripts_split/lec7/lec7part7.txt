So, we should say that d of S is 0. Separately, that is the only change we need to do to
handle the graphs which are not connected, but we will have to now change the
definition of shortest path tree. Earlier, what we said is that it is a sub graph of the given
graph which is a spanning tree. This means that every vertex is present on this tree and
the shortest path from S to each vertex in the graph is also equal to the distance from that

vertex S. In that tree there is precisely one path between any pair of vertices. So, what we
notice here is, in general the graph is not connected. Such a thing is not going to happen
there. So, what we will do is will redefine the notion of a shortest path tree as follows.
