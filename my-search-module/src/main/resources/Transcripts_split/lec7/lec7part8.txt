So, the definition is that for a graph G equal to V comma E and a given vertex S and V,
the shortest path tree is the sub graph T which is a tree and contains all vertices C. They
are reachable from S and del G S x is equal to del T S x for all x. So, we defined the
notion of reach ability. We say that a vertex is reachable, if there is at least one path
reachable from S to that vertex. So, all these vertices are not reachable. All these vertices
are reachable. So, our definition is that the shortest path tree is a tree, indeed it is a sub
graph of a given graph.
This means its edges are from the edges of the original graph G, but its vertices are only
those vertices of G which are reachable from S. So, it will be only restricted to this path.
The other part is the same, namely that the distance is short. It means the length of the
shortest path. The distance of each vertex from S is in G. It is same as the distance from
S to that vertex in T. So, with this definition we can handle the non connected graphs as
well. Now, we will define one more type of graph which are called directed graphs.
