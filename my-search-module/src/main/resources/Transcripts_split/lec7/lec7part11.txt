So, the claim is without proof, but the proof is very similar. Without proof, we can say
that, for any edge weighted graph with W going from E to R plus, this is to indicate that
negative numbers are not allowed, there exists a weighted shortest path tree for each S V.
So, in the next lecture, we will describe how to compute this. We will do that by
modifying this very algorithm suitably.
