In that case, the d value of V is less than or equal to d value x 1 plus 1. This one we have
proven. So, the vertex that comes earlier, its d value is lesser or equal to x 1. So, d of V is
less than equal to d x, which is equal to K minus 1 plus 1, that is equal to K. So, we
established that d V is less than or equal to K, but take a look at this claim. Here, d V can
never be less than delta of S V. Thus, delta of S V is K. So, putting it together we
conclude that this is say, d is less than equal to K. This is saying d V is greater than equal
to K. Hence, d V is equal to K.
So, we have proven that d V is equal to delta of S V, for V as well. So, we just proved
that d V is equal to delta S V, the shortest path length from S to V. This is also the
distance of V from S for every vertex. We also proved that there is a path from S to
vertex V of length of this. Hence, we can build by just tracing the parent going from
vertex to its parent and so on. So, we can from this information, deduce that path as we
output here the graph for this vertex. We set those edges, which are from vertex to its
parent on for every vertex other than S. So, we have all information in this graph about
the shortest path. Now, let us take a look at the time and space complexity right.
